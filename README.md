# Landing Page 

This is my landing page project from The Odin Project, and it was a fun and exciting journey to put my knowledge into practice and challenge myself! I often referred to resources online to understand how to approach certain tasks, and I realized that learning takes time. I look forward to learning more and building more projects!
